# Infinite_Addressable_LED_Motor_Control_Project
A multi controller, addressable device control project with synched controllers, to orchestrate large number of LEDs or Motors interacting with sensors or data.

This Project currently has "Taksim-Square-2006-Snow-LED-Light-Installation" Directory which contains Initial Seed Code for an Open Source Project, that I plan to conduct. The puclished directory has the PIC based Micro-Controller transmitter and receiver code.


Taksim-Square-2006-Snow-LED-Light-Installation:

The Taksim Symphony: Choreographing Istanbul in Light (2006)

This Project is the Initial Seed Code for an Open Source Project, that I plan to conduct.

Microcontroller based "PIC18F4620" Transmitter/Orchestrator, Receivers with addressable white LEDs: "PIC16F648", First installation: December 2006

Zerolight Taksim Square LED Installation December 2006 Lead Developer: Burçkaan Gürgün System Architecture: Developed for the PIC18F4620 microcontroller to orchestrate the LED infrastructure at Taksim Square. Technical Specifications: • Master Control: The system operates as a DMX Transmitter (Master), utilizing a custom-engineered RS-485 protocol for high-reliability communication. • Receiving Architecture: Interfaced with hundreds of decentralized DMX Receivers based on the PIC16F648 (running custom firmware). • Distributed Control: Each PIC16F648 receiver manages 8 individual single-color LED channels at unique addresses. • Orchestration: A single PIC18F4620 serves as the primary system orchestrator, managing the synchronized data flow across the vast network of hundreds of addressed nodes.

Looking back at one of the earliest and most intense milestones of my career. In November 2006, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality challenged us with a vision for the New Year, giving us just one month to execute it.

At the time, the concept of "pixel LEDs" didn’t exist in the market, and we had no ready-made software. We had to build everything from scratch.

The Tech: I designed custom LED bars using PIC16F648 microcontrollers and developed a DMX transmitter system on the PIC18F4620, pushing the memory limits to control thousands of cold-white LEDs suspended on steel cables.

The Soul: This wasn't just about digitizing public space; it was about meeting the city with emotion. Inspired by Sezen Aksu’s “İstanbul İstanbul Olalı,” I treated every light tone as a musical note.

When the system went live on December 15, 2006, the lights didn't just flash, they breathed in sync with the melody, creating a “city symphony” in the heart of Istanbul.

A massive thank you to Okan GÜRGÜN and ZEROLİGHT profesyonel led aydınlatma sistemleri team for helping turn this sleepless month of "superhuman effort" into a reality.

It remains a reminder that with enough conviction, we can build technology that truly touches the human spirit.
